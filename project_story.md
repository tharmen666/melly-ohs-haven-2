# Project Story – Melly: OHS Haven Safety Assistant

## Inspiration
Workplace safety is too often reduced to a checklist. Many workers, especially in multilingual and resource-limited environments, never fully understand compliance rules. This leads to preventable accidents, health risks, and legal issues.  
We built **Melly** to make safety **simple, engaging, and accessible**.

---

## What It Does
- Provides **short, animated training videos** in multiple languages (English, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Afrikaans).  
- Transforms static posters (e.g., FAST stroke awareness) into **dynamic explainer videos**.  
- Automates **compliance documents** such as checklists, certificates, and risk assessments.  
- Uses **Tableau-style dashboards** to visualize training progress and risk hotspots.  
- Acts as an **AI assistant** that guides workers and managers in real time.

## How We Built It
- **Gemini + Veo 3** → AI-generated explainer videos with narration.  
- **Google Vids** → Structured training video assembly.  
- **Python automation** → Generated certificates and filled OHS templates.  
- **Tableau dashboards** → Conceptual compliance visualizations.  
- **Branding & Design** → Posters, lanyards, and digital materials for OHS Haven.

## Challenges
